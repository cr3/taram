Docker
------

`Docker`_ is used for ease of deployment, modularity, and security. Hereâ€™s why:

* **Ease of Deployment & Portability**

  - Mail servers are complex, requiring multiple services (Postfix,
    Dovecot, Rspamd, ClamAV, etc.).
  - Docker Compose bundles everything into manageable containers.
  - Works consistently across different environments (Linux servers,
    cloud, VPS).

* **Modularity & Isolation**

  - Each service (Postfix, Dovecot, Rspamd, ClamAV, MySQL, etc.) runs
    in its own container.
  - If one component fails (e.g., Rspamd), others keep running.
  - Containers prevent dependency conflicts (e.g., different versions
    of OpenSSL, MySQL).

* **Security & Isolation**

  - Containers restrict services from accessing the host system directly.
  - Running in Docker minimizes risks compared to installing services directly.
  - Services have limited privileges and use internal Docker networks.
